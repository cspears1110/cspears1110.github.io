This post will discuss how we use <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, an online Kanban organizer.</p>\n<p>What is Trello? Trello markets itself as a way to collaboratively work with teams, organizing tasks in a \"fun\" and \"flexible\" manner. This is a strength of Kanban, which gives a visual feedback on work being completed. However, Trello is much more than an online Kanban board. Certainly it can be used for that, but Trello really lends itself to succinctly organizing <strong>any</strong> variety of work, adding members to help you collaborate on any project.</p>\n<p>As discussed previously, Kanban, at its basics, contains three columns: \"To-Do,\" where your backlog is prioritized, \"Doing\" where work is currently being completed, and \"Done,\" a record of work that has been completed, who completed it, and any additional details. If work is found to be lacking, a card can be moved back from \"Done\" into the backlog or into \"Doing.\" It's really that simple, and Trello helps facilitate this visually. Below is an example of our Trello Board, post-Coronavirus, set up to aid in the Kanban method, with personal information blurred.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 800px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/020d3/sfa_trello_board.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.72222222222223%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAC1klEQVQozyWR22scZRjG519RQYnSJooXhdZKFS8reNVe9KYgKHgjeNcbbwRBK2q9KEasB0yb05KCDZukiVGaBJfStE32NDvd2d3ZmW/O883s7uwm29hfv9YP3ovv9Hve53m10u8X2f7tQ7auXeD2H1+wsrRI4acvWfnqJCtfv8Xty6fY/OE91r97l9UrZ9m4ep5bVz9h8ddp1hamWf/2HVa/Oc3dn8+x8/15tG71FmHnHtLaxevUaNTLCNNEOhVic4u2/g+ps0ffLZPYDyg37vOoUSUOI2LPQdS3CNv3SJ69f/Ajmmk2aNoJHSEJowTh2sSJZHgIAylIsj6Hj+EIyIMWblWnNzpidDDG8wJalkfXTRiMIar+ifbIMGk0LQyzi2PbeHGEVLf5gQJkLmVzDy8MlUgP366xa+4yGOU8W5HXxvNDEpk933f0fTRLWPQGOU/UQS8ReLUNHH2LuFUiNNa4b5WIskR96hM4OqX2PnYUMhqNiUQDPwgJQknaG+JZJpobOgxHI5QDUs8gXZhEzh1T9RrJzTM8bFcRYUwkh6SBiekIFU+kADmxMAh8nyiKlcCIwDLQHNukPxgyPDhSigb27NvIhTdIFVDePE3d+BvLUta6TWyjgV2rEWc9BvkI6bcR8RgnUt2qFOzyJpoQFQ7/ex4BSSBYm52mtfwpvfkJ5PwUWeEU+txFjGsnEOuXaAYp6bDPYzWlTMUhNi/h3/kc798rGEsfKWBrl0B4SnGIDF2q22s07/xCOn9cdTqloMdVDKpmXyZZfh/Ti3CDgFQNLm7dJZl5kezGC8iZl5A3JtBSW6ddN3HjHN910XeWaZRWSQonle1XFXhSAacU8BVk8QOEzEnzMUdqir5j4y+dJVs4Rlp4k2zxdZXh/hx2/S8CfYNudZvK8mVqO0VE8WPiwgmipTP/lxKIiufoVIp06spq8yHNyh7dlc8IZibwrk/hX5/kKRwR7KdKlCulAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"SFA Trello Board, Post-Coronavirus\"\n        title=\"SFA Trello Board, Post-Coronavirus\"\n        src=\"/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/11d19/sfa_trello_board.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/40714/sfa_trello_board.png 200w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/a8246/sfa_trello_board.png 400w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/11d19/sfa_trello_board.png 800w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/f0628/sfa_trello_board.png 1200w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/75d76/sfa_trello_board.png 1600w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/020d3/sfa_trello_board.png 2880w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If you look closely, you'll see a couple of extra columns, \"Validation\" and \"Project Ideas\". Validation is another safe Agile principle, where accountability for any piece of work can be checked. In our case, we verify that the portion of work has been completed satisfactorily, either confirmed by another manager or by a director. The Project Ideas column is more self-explanatory: a Kanban-adjacent column where board members can comment on any large project ideas.</p>\n<p>Getting our directors and staff up and running with Trello was a breeze, as both the mobile and web application offer easy setup. The free-tier offers an unlimited number of boards, as well as members joining that board. We were even able to create a \"Director's Only\" Trello board where the managers are unable to view upcoming work they would not by privy to as students. I had created a Google Slides for the managers and directors to quickly onboar; I've shared that below as well as in the Resources section, to use at your convenience.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTG-cPZsVq2t80ZZ6EsaWdKtyurpycACRlLiIEQFm6u3g3D5aGE22SXWU6QkHEKQeIXkPybC6cT-1nU/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"388\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>Trello has been a major stepping-stone towards allowing our staff to become more involved in projects, as well as bolstering communication. Trello's easy-to-use format lets pieces of work be created quickly, and allows to see what is being worked on at-a-glance. Combining project management skills picked up in the Software Developoment industry and music education has become a large interest of mine, and I have been studying its effects and efficiency closely. Directly after I had helped set up Trello with a director, they turned to me saying, \"You've directly added value to this program,\" and that's really all the thanks I needed.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14-GsZnQcG4U6aRQuUm7wpIKhmJLkgxYtK1VfzhQc-Rc/edit?usp=sharing\">Trello Onboarding Slides</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colekspears\">@colekspears</a></p>\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A director just told me I was adding value to the band program and it has never made me more happy</p>&mdash; Cole Spears (@colekspears) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colekspears/status/1221894756130852864\">January 27, 2020</a></blockquote></p>","excerpt":"In a previous post, I talked about introducing our band's staff to a software methodology called \"Kanban\" in order to streamline our work and see at-a-glance…","frontmatter":{"date":"March 26, 2020","path":"/blog/band-kanban-trello","title":"Band + Kanban: Using Trello","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/a0205/sticky_organized.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/b17c1/sticky_organized.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/00e5e/sticky_organized.jpg 200w,\n/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/1a903/sticky_organized.jpg 400w,\n/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/b17c1/sticky_organized.jpg 800w,\n/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/2f073/sticky_organized.jpg 1200w,\n/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/48ee2/sticky_organized.jpg 1600w,\n/static/2da4897982589ec67fa4539e39e42dff/3dca8/sticky_organized.jpg 6000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{}}}
