Austin State University. A typical administration undergraduate position: print upcoming cycle music, set up rehearsal areas, as well as the manage intrument catalog through Charms. However, the manager team was having trouble communicating to each other: a shift would end, and a manager would leave while another comes in, and the new shift would have absolutely no idea where to start working. Enter Kanban.</p>\n<p>Let's step back a bit: Kanban is a derivative, a flavor, of Agile, a concept familiar in the Software Development world. Agile is a software methodology used to quickly, and iteritvely, deliver value to a customer. A majority of start-up companies are utilizing this relativeley new method to quickly design, develop and deliver new applications. Previously, companies would develop an application through a rigid process, moving strictly from designing, then developing, then delivering, known colloquially as \"Waterfall\". But what happens in your development phase when the customer suggests a new design? Teams would have to start from scratch, or, worse, deliver a product that did not meet the client's standards.</p>\n<p>Agile, as well as Kanban, solves this problem by introducing iterable, bite-size stories (formatted \"I, as a <strong>(role)</strong>, want <strong>(goal)</strong>, so that <strong>(value)</strong>\") that add value to a product. In the Band Administration world, this is your band program. Every small story builds and builds towards a feature, and every feature towards an over-arching epic.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 800px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/cac3b/sticky_note_grid.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.6796875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Sticky Note Grid\"\n        title=\"Sticky Note Grid\"\n        src=\"/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/f67cc/sticky_note_grid.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/9c38a/sticky_note_grid.jpg 200w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/28275/sticky_note_grid.jpg 400w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/f67cc/sticky_note_grid.jpg 800w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/6e525/sticky_note_grid.jpg 1200w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/e735c/sticky_note_grid.jpg 1600w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/cac3b/sticky_note_grid.jpg 2560w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Simply put, Kanban creates a simple grid to streamline work. There exists three columns: \"To Do\", \"Doing\", and \"Done\". The entire backlog, created by the directors or managers, is filled in the \"To Do\" column, typically ordered by priority. Managers move tasks into \"Doing\" when they are working on a story, and then into \"Done\" when completed.</p>\n<p>Moving the entire staff over to a Kanban workflow, while challenging at first, as helped to streamline work being done, as well as fostering consistency between managers. It allows the directors to know <strong>at-a-glance</strong> what work is currently being done, as well as what needs to be worked on next. We as a staff use a application called <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, which acts as an online whiteboard grid for our backlog. Stay tuned for a future post about our experience with Trello.</p>\n<p>Next step: move everyone over to <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> for communication.</p>\n<h2>Read more:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.alexandercowan.com/agile-just-basics/\">Agile</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Agile Manifesto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-101-learn-the-basics/\">Kanban</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trello.com/en-US/guide/trello-101\">Trello</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colekspears\">@colekspears</a></p>\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Meet Biscuit <a href=\"https://t.co/xcPmbtvZaO\">pic.twitter.com/xcPmbtvZaO</a></p>&mdash; Cole Spears (@colekspears) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colekspears/status/1209148672983945216\">December 23, 2019</a></blockquote></p>","excerpt":"Starting last winter, I was fortunate enough to land a position as a Band Manager at Stephen F.
