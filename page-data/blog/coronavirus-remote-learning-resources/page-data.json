I recently curated a list of easy-to-use applications, shown below, but I will be discussing my top selections in each category: Messaging &#x26; Video, File Hosting, Document Preparation, and Organization.</p>\n<h2>Messaging &#x26; Video</h2>\n<h3>Slack</h3>\n<p>Slack is primarily used in the Software Development world to communicate between teams. It provides a myriad of rich text options, as well as many, many third-party plugins, such as Google Drive, Skype, and Zoom. Teachers can create a \"workspace\" for their classroom, where they can then create different \"channels\" for topical discussion, such as tutoring or final project. Slack's free tier lacks in file storage (up to 5GB), but that can be easily solved by utilizing the Google Drive plugin. Slack, overall, offers a concise and contained communication solution that is easy to pick up.</p>\n<h2>File Hosting</h2>\n<h3>Google Drive</h3>\n<p>Most educators are likely familiar with Google's file storage solution. It can hold virtually any file type, and allows for any or certain members to download or host files. The only catch is that the user needs to have a Google account. Otherwise, Google Drive offers a fluid design that aids in any workflow.</p>\n<h3>Honorable Mention: GitHub</h3>\n<p>GitHub is a code repository for both enterprises as well as hobbyists. While the majority of it is used to host code and applications, it's feasible that it can be used to host assignments as well. Students wouldn't have to become familiar with git, a system used for code version control, as the GitHub web app offers a user-friendly way to commit new changes and file uploads.</p>\n<h2>Document Preparation</h2>\n<h3>Google Suite</h3>\n<p>Again, likely the most familiar out of the other document preparation resources. The primary stregth of tools like Docs, Slides, and Sheets is its real-time collaboration with other users. This is a game changer, allowing students to work together with each other at any distance seamlessly.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that Google offers its own LMS solution, called \"Google Classroom.\" If you haven't heard about it, you should definitely <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?modal_active=none\">check it out</a>.</p>\n<h2>Organization</h2>\n<h3>Trello</h3>\n<p>Trello is an online-whiteboard solution used to organize large projects. Users can create different themed-columns, wherein resides tasks to be completed. These tasks can be moved from one column to another, showing progress of work. Trello works well with a project management methodology called \"Kanban,\" where these columns are labeled \"To Do,\" \"Doing,\" and \"Done.\" Tasks move between these columns when in progress and completed. You can check out my posts about Kanban and how my staff implemented Trello <a href=\"/blog/band-kanban-trello\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colekspears\">@colekspears</a></p>\n<p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As classrooms begin to transition towards online-only, it’s important for educators to know the tools available to them and their students.
