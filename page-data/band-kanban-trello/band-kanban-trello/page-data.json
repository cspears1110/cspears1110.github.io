This post will discuss how we use <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, an online Kanban organizer.</p>\n<p>What is Trello? Trello markets itself as a way to collaboratively work with teams, organizing tasks in a “fun” and “flexible” manner. This is a strength of Kanban, which gives a visual feedback on work being completed. However, Trello is much more than an online Kanban board. Certainly it can be used for that, but Trello really lends itself to succinctly organizing <strong>any</strong> variety of work, adding members to help you collaborate on any project.</p>\n<p>As discussed previously, Kanban, at its basics, contains three columns: “To-Do,” where your backlog is prioritized, “Doing” where work is currently being completed, and “Done,” a record of work that has been completed, who completed it, and any additional details. If work is found to be lacking, a card can be moved back from “Done” into the backlog or into “Doing.” It’s really that simple, and Trello helps facilitate this visually. Below is an example of our Trello Board, post-Coronavirus, set up to aid in the Kanban method, with personal information blurred.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/f9c26/sfa_trello_board.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.800000000000004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAC3UlEQVQozy2S3WscVRjG58/wVgJqxZq2okVLpeCV4I2CClIVxAu9EC/8C3pT2tJSIYIUexGFJG12W4tNm8SSpjG6bU3SkG52t7MzO7uzM7Pz/bmf2ST78zR44OGci/d9zvN7z5EKk1+yOvkVK1dPszB1kbl8jtzED9w9e4w7595m8fxxln58j8WLJ7l7+QPuTXzIzYnvmZ28KurPM3/uTRYuvcu/Vz7lr8ufIDXLcwT1x4RCplZCLhexNZWouY5bXaJRuU9ibJAJefo6Tyvr1KslQj/EN2tY5WUCTfQ3NwgenUWqNepoVozpZvhBQMs2ieOM/s6INBTn9oDhPuwBafMZLUWnPdij1x9gWQ51w6XlpXSH4K5dQVKUOrKqo2qGKDBw45ikMxSGwiBsUGpU8MOIKEqw9C2e6tsMd4eM9vdxLQ3HC0nTjOdL3iwIZJGo2+uzP4LYqWHLf2Opa8TNTWx1iU3rCWk7IwyFoVHioV7CjxP6osc3ZbwgPlDW6WEqZSQ3chgMBuwIplhbJp55mSj/Fsm1V/EWPmPLbIoGMa8wI/ZUqqaL5TxP1SawZFzPF5eF9Pt9LGUbyXYMOt0enQF4ygrO1DhJ/hjpzEsE8x8J5C1syxQyMGVZpFCIsi6ddofAaWDHI1rhLlEP9LVbSI6vsTc6GAGGWuLe9E/Yc5+TXj9EkjtCdOt9Ste+Rvv1BMY/P1OP2nT6HXYFUVRdxFo5g1u4gPX4F5TcF0hWY5vAC8Sr7eAbKsXVP9GXLwjDV4hzR0lmXyOeHSedfhF/6VtqQU9g2mQiUVDMkfz2gqAZI54aIxJjkiJdoS43cJMdWrpKpbBIrXBdGB3+X68fJE2mxwgffEerDe3ugF1B1FI2CfInSPNHSW+8cbBLZvkPzGcP8NRVGlv3Kd25hPxwHvf2x4Q33iG4eYrg91OEueMi4TfUKysY1Sfi8xdRixu0bp/GmzqEM30Eb2ac/wB/Q+r6wjNrZAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"SFA Trello Board, During Coronavirus Pandemic, Spring 2020\"\n        title=\"SFA Trello Board, During Coronavirus Pandemic, Spring 2020\"\n        src=\"/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/f97d7/sfa_trello_board.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/0eb09/sfa_trello_board.png 500w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/1263b/sfa_trello_board.png 1000w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/f97d7/sfa_trello_board.png 2000w,\n/static/33abd38141ff6fc00dcacf557b31bdfb/f9c26/sfa_trello_board.png 2880w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If you look closely, you’ll see a couple of extra columns, “Validation” and “Project Ideas”.
