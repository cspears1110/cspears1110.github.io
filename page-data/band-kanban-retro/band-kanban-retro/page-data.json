Austin State University. It is a typical administration undergraduate position in the music department: printing upcoming cycle music, setting up rehearsal spaces, as well as the managing the intrument catalog through Charms. However, the manager team was having trouble communicating with each other: a new shift would start and have absolutely no idea where to begin working. Enter Kanban.</p>\n<p>Let’s step back a bit: Kanban is a derivative, a flavor, of Agile, which is a concept familiar in the Software Development world. Agile is a software methodology used to quickly, and iteritvely, deliver value to a customer. Through small pieces of work called “stories,” work was able to be assigned value and picked up by anyone on a team. A majority of start-up companies are utilizing this relativeley new method to quickly design, develop and deliver new applications. Previously, companies would develop an application through a rigid process, moving strictly from one stage to another, known colloquially as “Waterfall.” But what happens when the customer suggests a new completely new design when your team is already working on implementation? Teams would have to start from scratch, or, worse, deliver a product that did not meet the client’s standards.</p>\n<p>Agile, as well as Kanban, works to solve this problem by introducing iterable, bite-size stories (formatted “I, as a <strong>(role)</strong>, want <strong>(goal)</strong>, so that <strong>(value)</strong>”) that add value to a product. In the Band Administration world, this is your band program. Every small story builds and builds towards a specific feature, and every feature towards an over-arching epic. Features would equate to large scale projects, such as re-cataloging instrument inventory, and epics would equate to sub-programs in your band, such as the marching band.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 2000px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/36eba/sticky_note_grid.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.60000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Sticky Note Grid\"\n        title=\"Sticky Note Grid\"\n        src=\"/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/451a4/sticky_note_grid.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/953fe/sticky_note_grid.jpg 500w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/0a251/sticky_note_grid.jpg 1000w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/451a4/sticky_note_grid.jpg 2000w,\n/static/7dce03ec3f6eac716ed2b6e6f1ca4fd9/36eba/sticky_note_grid.jpg 2560w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Let’s jump back to Kanban. Simply put, Kanban creates a simple Agile grid to streamline work. On a Kanban board, there exists three columns: “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done.” The entire backlog of work, created by the directors or managers, is filled in the “To Do” column, typically ordered by priority. Managers move tasks into “Doing” when they are working on a story, and then into “Done” when completed. The beauty of Kanban lies primarily in this simiplistic yet powerful format.</p>\n<p>Moving the entire staff over to a Kanban workflow, while challenging at first, has helped to streamline work being done, as well as fostering consistency between managers. It allows the directors to know <strong>at-a-glance</strong> what work is currently being done, as well as what needs to be picked up next. It lets the staff remain accountable to each other, and stregthens communication. We as a staff use an application called <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, which acts as an online whiteboard grid for our backlog.
