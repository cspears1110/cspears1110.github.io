&lt;p&gt;Lori Laitman remains one of the most prolific and performed composers of American song of the last several decades. In Carol Kimball’s authoritative compendium on art song, Laitman describes her own style as “timeless, beautiful, and lyrical” (2006, 339). A graduate of the Yale School of Music, Laitman studied both composition and flute, though eventually expressed her affinity towards composing art song, saying, “I found my voice in writing for voice” (2012). While her catalog is comprised of a variety of works, including opera, oratorio, and orchestral arrangements, she has found prominence and critical acclaim in the vocal world through her settings of intimate poetry, perfectly setting to music what the text warrants. She regularly writes upon themes of tragedy and unrest, showcased in her &lt;em&gt;I Never Saw Another Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; cycle as well as her upcoming opera &lt;em&gt;Ludlow&lt;/em&gt;, exploring “the U.S. immigrant experience through the lens of the 1914 Colorado mining town disaster” (2020).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Berg writes of Laitman, “It is difficult to think of anyone before the public today who equals her exceptional gifts for embracing a poetic text and giving it new and deeper life through music” (2007, 612). Laitman’s song cycle &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Redwood&lt;/em&gt; is no exception: composed as a gift for her husband’s 50th birthday in 2003, &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Redwood&lt;/em&gt; remains a staple in her art song catalog, touching on themes of love, grief, time, and healing. Though this work has been released for well over a decade now, immense popularity for the cycle has driven Laitman to revise her separate orchestration for high voice and chamber orchestra, set to release during the 2020-2021 season (Laitman, 2003). Her original edition for high voice and piano stands as a monumental feat in her repertoire, connecting with an audience in the way that only music can. Utilizing a myriad of compositional techniques such as unstable tonal centers, motivic material, and deep textual subtext, Laitman draws a line from the themes of love to loss and finally healing as a profound journey into the human soul. This paper will explore Laitman’s setting of Dana Gioia’s texts as well as word painting techniques she employs to vividly paint the themes found in her music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Laitman’s longest collaborators since the turn of the millennium, Dana Gioia has had an illustrious career both as a businessman and a poet. Gioia attended Harvard, where he completed his MA in comparative literature, however soon found himself as the vice president of General Foods, marketing products such as “Kool-Aid” (Poetry Foundation, n.d.). However, he soon turned his full attention to poetry, and most recently served as the California Poet laureate and Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (Gioia, n.d.). Gioia’s work frequently employs free and accentual-verse, a natural fit for Laitman’s through-composed style. &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Redwood&lt;/em&gt; features a majority of Gioia’s text in free-verse, with some selections of the text showing thought towards a concrete meter, only to be thwarted by a return to the previous loose structure. Laitman acknowledges this and sets the text with a loose form as well, weaving in motivic material in the tonally-rich texture through each of her through-composed songs. Figure 1 shows a syllabic analysis of the text from the cycle with distinct patterns of stress blocked, while Figure 2 shows a form diagram for each of the four songs in &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Redwood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening piece of Laitman’s cycle, “The Song,” remains uniquely different from the rest of the work, as its original text is loosely based on another poem by German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, affectionately titled &lt;em&gt;Liebeslied&lt;/em&gt;. While Gioia provides the text Laitman ultimately uses, a cursory study of the differences between the two is appropriate. The English translation of Rilke’s text is provided by Elisabeth Siekhaus (2008), shown in Figure 3. Where Rilke uses a plethora of iambic meter (though, through the use of enjambment, the meter fluctuates), Gioia morphs the original text to better fit his own free-verse style. The rhyme scheme is removed completely, primarily through the initial translation, and the two stanzas are reorganized,
splitting instead a line further down as compared to the original. Gioia does keep most of the iambic syllables, as shown in Figure 1, however, the second stanza breaks from that pattern, only to return in the final, non-rhyming couplet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Song” opens in D-flat major with a distinct Lydian flavor in the accompaniment. The tonal center soon develops, moving into C-sharp minor, then D major, then C major in mm.14-22, ending on a definitive E major by m. 23. Laitman enjoys using chromatic mediants to shift tonal centers, highlighting the relationship between mm. 17-18, and mm. 21-23. Such a technique, particularly when employed in this piece, helps to depict the deep connection between the singer and their beloved. An enharmonic Lydian returns in the interlude, where C-sharp is recast as the original D-flat major in m. 34. This recurring Lydian modality strikes the ears as two distinct tonal centers, again signifying the singer’s relationship to their beloved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her DMA dissertation, Lucy Owens Hoyt introduces the beginning of the second stanza as the “love motive” (25), symbolizing yearning and unity. The motive is underlined by the voice, “like a bow / that from two strings can draw one voice.” This musical language denoting double stop technique is applicable here as the verse becomes looser, abandoning the iambic meter to weave in portions of trochee effectively introducing the singer’s beloved. “The Song” moves into the postlude on a delicious sustained 2” sung by the vocal line, with the accompaniment returning to the Lydian flavor introduced in the opening statement, ending on a soft 5” octave in m. 61. This inconclusive ending, which traditionally could be labeled a HC, paired with the sustained vocal line, suggests that the love song continues on uninterrupted, blissfully unaware of any trouble that they may soon face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pentecost&lt;/h2&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Gillespie (2008) writes of Gioia’s “Pentecost,” “[Gioia] is at his best when he doesn’t have to hew to a meter or rhyme scheme. [Pentecost] is the poetry of a direct and unpretentious voice.” Indeed, such a voice lends itself well to “Pentecost,” as the poem was written following the untimely death of Gioia’s infant son. While it serves as the emotional pivot of the cycle, the text is laden with themes of guilt, anguish, and grief. Scriptural language and how it is treated musically, both from the title and primarily the final two stanzas, lead the listener to consider the dissonance between supernatural change and the impending toll it has on one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pentecost” opens with a B-flat minor triad in the accompaniment, with the octave-displaced scale-degree 3-2 suspension. This motion occurs heavily in the opening bars, soon outlining an E-flat minor triad in mm. 5-9. These four bars form an ostinato vamp between the tonic and subdominant which continues throughout the work, though it will soon slip in tonality. The plagal vamp, while obscured in the accompaniment, is Laitman’s first technique employed with hints of religious connotation. The first motivic material Laitman introduces can be found in the opening vocal line in mm. 4-5. Hoyt calls this the “sorrow motive,” (30) compared to the more prevalent “keening motive” (30) found in mm 15-16. The keening motive is of great importance, as its cascading figure denotes a rush of emotions felt prominently throughout the song. While the former is used less frequently than the latter in this song, both are influential in the work and reappear in the cycle’s conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the motivic threads throughout the work, the primary compositional technique Laitman employs in this song is melodic repetition. Figure 4 shows how the right hand of the piano precisely echoes the melody. Laitman argues in her notes that this melodic repetition, as well as the harmonic vamp, work to provide immense tension, tension which does not relent. Musically, the repetition could also signify the echoes of the beloved, now lost in death. By m. 18, the song slips delectably into A minor, a half-step down from the original B-flat minor tonality, continuing the previous melodic phrase (though separated by a stanza in Gioia’s text) by listing off elements of nature that do not provide the singer release (“Nor the night… / Nor the morning’s ache…”). Laitman’s singer looks toward creation for solace and peace, however, is remiss to find any. A final plea to “an unknowable god,” which shows the first return of the keening motive, shifts the tonality to an abrupt extended C-sharp minor, with the voice singing a dissonant F-sharp 5. This sudden change in m. 27 serves to accentuate the Scriptural language of “fire”, felt both figuratively and spiritually. A return to the i – iv vamp, as well as the keening motive in m. 38, finds the song slip tonality once again in m. 40 to C minor, with more clear language depicting the Apostle’s event of Pentecost (“And our innocence consumed by these implacable tongues of fire”). Again, the singer is struggling with the dichotomy between supernatural change, being chosen by God, and the immense grief of loss and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece ends on the climatic last stanza, wailing, “Comfort me with stones. Quench my thirst with sand.” Dramatic octave leaps portray immense, consuming grief, with the melodic apex of the entire cycle occurring on the B-flat 5 in m. 45, melting into sadness. This language evokes texts from Scripture, such as the Temptation of Christ as well as the Israelites in the Wilderness, depicting moments of intense desire for release. Directly following the wailing occurs the first, and only, substantial major chord of the entire song; the A-flat major in m. 47 signifies potential personal breakthrough, moving from grief to acceptance. However, the song quickly returns to its original plagal vamp, ending with the phrase “until others mix our ashes.” This Homer-esque language of mixing ashes stands in juxtaposition with the previous Scriptural verbiage, however, serves to again mark tragedy, evoking imagery of Achilles. The work ends with a vocalized lament figure filled with grief. The keening motive returns in the final three bars, where the accompaniment drops out to let the vocal line sustain briefly. It’s important to note that Laitman enhances the original text twice, repeating the words “Death” and “others” in m. 34 and m. 50 respectively. The former reiterates the impact death has on the living, while the latter suggests the converse and the relation between the living and the dead. “Pentecost” remains a dark, beautiful stand-alone work, however, when placed into the context of the cycle as a whole, denotes prevailing sadness and impending loss, filled with tones of inconsolable grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Curriculum Vitae” is the shortest of all the songs in the cycle. Though the entire piece only lasts 21 measures, such a short text and song serve to underline how the passage of time seems blinding in retrospection, offering healing that moves unbearably slow in the interim. The piece thematically functions best following the intensity of “Pentecost.” Laitman writes in her score notes that she “chose to mimic the carillon, which… is a symbol of the passing of time.” This bell tolling is most prevalent at the start and end of the work, as the accompaniment features distinct quartal and quintal patterns in a high register, with the last two notes of m. 16 displaced down an octave. The song ends with a tolling of a G4, disappearing as time rushes forward. The prevalent mixed meter featured in this work inhabits a form of timelessness and improvisation, serving the subtext of the poetry well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final song in Laitman’s eponymous cycle brings the work to completion, detailing personal growth through acceptance of the past, refined by the passage of time. A cursory listening evokes the pastoral imagery used prominently by Corigliano and Heggie, however, the song serves as the capstone in Laitman’s journey, using the imagery of rising redwoods to show inevitable maturity. Its opening text, “Stand in a field long enough, and the sounds / start up again,” speaks to stillness and how a normalcy eventually returns. Laitman paints the elements of nature, with dominant octaves symbolizing the redwoods, an octave jump of a cluster chord for the crickets, as well as the “invisible toad” through a momentary silence. The work begins in a solid G major tonality, and soon introduces elements from the previous songs. The melodic repetition found in “Pentecost” makes a reappearance in m. 9, a chromatic mediant shift in m. 11, as well as the Hoyt’s (37) love motive in mm. 38-41 (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only motivic recall found in the work, as the sorrow motive (Figure 6) and bell tolling (Figure 7) reappear in mm. 106-107 and mm. 108-112 respectively. This technique works to recall the listener to the singer’s previous states through the cycle: wide-eyed, falling into despair, passing through time, and finally arriving at healing in the final song. The listener eventually finds solace through creation, a distinct difference from “Pentecost”, comparing their own life to that of the redwoods. Redwoods, the highest of all the trees, thrive in a connected ecosystem. They are, though, volatile and are easily susceptible to fire. However, the fire is cleansing, much like the Apostle’s Pentecost, and the trees soon grow back stronger. This doesn’t mean that trouble won’t arise; Laitman paints discord through a shift to minor tonality, most notably in mm. 70-77. The coyotes and feral dogs provide a sense of danger; however, the singer remains steadfast as a redwood. Finally, the keening motive ominously returns in m. 97 (Figure 8), this time more aware and ready for loss that lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through employing extensive word painting, motivic devices that span the cycle, as well as deep subtextual language, Laitman completes a masterful song cycle, one that is worthy of every laud it receives. &lt;em&gt;Becoming a Redwood&lt;/em&gt; is much less a “how-to” guide more than it reads as a journey into the depths of humanity, guiding the listener through the stages of love, grief, time, and healing. Its most powerful moment resides in the second song, offering the listener to dwell on their own life and miseries. It suggests that the flow of time offers ultimate healing. Its rising heights and soaring boughs in the final song of the cycle point not towards the heavens, but to the firm, solid foundation now revealed through acceptance, lessons learned, and the passage of time. Laitman successfully crafts a splendid cycle from Dana Gioia’s text, giving the work the quality it’s due.&lt;/p&gt;

This post will discuss how we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, an online Kanban organizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Trello? Trello markets itself as a way to collaboratively work with teams, organizing tasks in a “fun” and “flexible” manner. This is a strength of Kanban, which gives a visual feedback on work being completed. However, Trello is much more than an online Kanban board. Certainly it can be used for that, but Trello really lends itself to succinctly organizing &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; variety of work, adding members to help you collaborate on any project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed previously, Kanban, at its basics, contains three columns: “To-Do,” where your backlog is prioritized, “Doing” where work is currently being completed, and “Done,” a record of work that has been completed, who completed it, and any additional details. If work is found to be lacking, a card can be moved back from “Done” into the backlog or into “Doing.” It’s really that simple, and Trello helps facilitate this visually. Below is an example of our Trello Board, post-Coronavirus, set up to aid in the Kanban method, with personal information blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look closely, you’ll see a couple of extra columns, “Validation” and “Project Ideas”. Validation is another safe Agile principle, where accountability for any piece of work can be checked. In our case, we verify that the portion of work has been completed satisfactorily, either confirmed by another manager or by a director. The Project Ideas column is more self-explanatory: a Kanban-adjacent column where board members can comment on any large project ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting our directors and staff up and running with Trello was a breeze, as both the mobile and web application offer easy setup. The free-tier offers an unlimited number of boards, as well as members joining that board. We were even able to create a “Director’s Only” Trello board where the managers are unable to view upcoming work they would not by privy to as students. I had created a Google Slides for the managers and directors to quickly onboar; I’ve shared that below as well as in the Resources section, to use at your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTG-cPZsVq2t80ZZ6EsaWdKtyurpycACRlLiIEQFm6u3g3D5aGE22SXWU6QkHEKQeIXkPybC6cT-1nU/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=60000&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;388&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trello has been a major stepping-stone towards allowing our staff to become more involved in projects, as well as bolstering communication. Trello’s easy-to-use format lets pieces of work be created quickly, and allows to see what is being worked on at-a-glance. Combining project management skills picked up in the Software Developoment industry and music education has become a large interest of mine, and I have been studying its effects and efficiency closely. Directly after I had helped set up Trello with a director, they turned to me saying, “You’ve directly added value to this program,” and that’s really all the thanks I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

Austin State University. It is a typical administration undergraduate position in the music department: printing upcoming cycle music, setting up rehearsal spaces, as well as the managing the intrument catalog through Charms. However, the manager team was having trouble communicating with each other: a new shift would start and have absolutely no idea where to begin working. Enter Kanban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back a bit: Kanban is a derivative, a flavor, of Agile, which is a concept familiar in the Software Development world. Agile is a software methodology used to quickly, and iteritvely, deliver value to a customer. Through small pieces of work called “stories,” work was able to be assigned value and picked up by anyone on a team. A majority of start-up companies are utilizing this relativeley new method to quickly design, develop and deliver new applications. Previously, companies would develop an application through a rigid process, moving strictly from one stage to another, known colloquially as “Waterfall.” But what happens when the customer suggests a new completely new design when your team is already working on implementation? Teams would have to start from scratch, or, worse, deliver a product that did not meet the client’s standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile, as well as Kanban, works to solve this problem by introducing iterable, bite-size stories (formatted “I, as a &lt;strong&gt;(role)&lt;/strong&gt;, want &lt;strong&gt;(goal)&lt;/strong&gt;, so that &lt;strong&gt;(value)&lt;/strong&gt;”) that add value to a product. In the Band Administration world, this is your band program. Every small story builds and builds towards a specific feature, and every feature towards an over-arching epic. Features would equate to large scale projects, such as re-cataloging instrument inventory, and epics would equate to sub-programs in your band, such as the marching band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump back to Kanban. Simply put, Kanban creates a simple Agile grid to streamline work. On a Kanban board, there exists three columns: “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done.” The entire backlog of work, created by the directors or managers, is filled in the “To Do” column, typically ordered by priority. Managers move tasks into “Doing” when they are working on a story, and then into “Done” when completed. The beauty of Kanban lies primarily in this simiplistic yet powerful format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the entire staff over to a Kanban workflow, while challenging at first, has helped to streamline work being done, as well as fostering consistency between managers. It allows the directors to know &lt;strong&gt;at-a-glance&lt;/strong&gt; what work is currently being done, as well as what needs to be picked up next. It lets the staff remain accountable to each other, and stregthens communication. We as a staff use an application called &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as an online whiteboard grid for our backlog. You can check out that post &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/band-kanban-trello&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next goal: move everyone over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; for work communication.&lt;/p&gt;

While there, I was able to travel and experience a myriad of locales, from Bach’s Thomaskirche and Athens, Greece, to even a trip to London, Scotland, and Ireland during holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting a contemporary church with friends, I was able to talk to the lead worship singer, who spoke extremely fluent English. He told me that he what had helped him pick up a new language was taking vocabulary from English-sung Contemporary Christian Music and listening to the songs on repeat. In order to reverse-engineer (to much less success, I must admit) this, I’ve curated the below playlist. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently curated a list of easy-to-use applications, shown below, but I will be discussing my top selections in each category: Messaging &amp;#x26; Video, File Hosting, Document Preparation, and Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Messaging &amp;#x26; Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is primarily used in the Software Development world to communicate between teams. It provides a myriad of rich text options, as well as many, many third-party plugins, such as Google Drive, Skype, and Zoom. Teachers can create a “workspace” for their classroom, where they can then create different “channels” for topical discussion, such as tutoring or final project. Slack’s free tier lacks in file storage (up to 5GB), but that can be easily solved by utilizing the Google Drive plugin. Slack, overall, offers a concise and contained communication solution that is easy to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;File Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most educators are likely familiar with Google’s file storage solution. It can hold virtually any file type, and allows for any or certain members to download or host files. The only catch is that the user needs to have a Google account. Otherwise, Google Drive offers a fluid design that aids in any workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Honorable Mention: GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub is a code repository for both enterprises as well as hobbyists. While the majority of it is used to host code and applications, it’s feasible that it can be used to host assignments as well. Students wouldn’t have to become familiar with git, a system used for code version control, as the GitHub web app offers a user-friendly way to commit new changes and file uploads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Document Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google Suite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, likely the most familiar out of the other document preparation resources. The primary stregth of tools like Docs, Slides, and Sheets is its real-time collaboration with other users. This is a game changer, allowing students to work together with each other at any distance seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that Google offers its own LMS solution, called “Google Classroom.” If you haven’t heard about it, you should definitely &lt;a href=&quot;https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?modal_active=none&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Organization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trello&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trello is an online-whiteboard solution used to organize large projects. Users can create different themed-columns, wherein resides tasks to be completed. These tasks can be moved from one column to another, showing progress of work. Trello works well with a project management methodology called “Kanban,” where these columns are labeled “To Do,” “Doing,” and “Done.” Tasks move between these columns when in progress and completed. You can check out my posts about Kanban and how my staff implemented Trello &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/band-kanban-trello&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-dnt=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As classrooms begin to transition towards online-only, it’s important for educators to know the tools available to them and their students. Below is a short compilation of free software alternatives for classrooms without education tools like Canvas, Blackboard, D2L, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tThdQo701I&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tThdQo701I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; can&amp;#39;t talk, arranging sing song (@colekspears) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/colekspears/status/1238209669426024452&quot;&gt;March 12, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sing Song]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sing Song, one of Abilene Christian Univeristy’s most-loved traditions since 1957, is an a cappella singing competition in which students…]]></description><link>https://cspears1110.github.io/sing-song/sing-song/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://cspears1110.github.io/sing-song/sing-song/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sing Song, one of Abilene Christian Univeristy’s most-loved traditions since 1957, is an a cappella singing competition in which students prepare rewritten medleys of popular songs that are performed with costumes, sets, and choreography that relate to their chosen theme. Each year, a top act is chosen from each of the three divisions: Men’s, Women’s, and Class, where the winning acts are awarded $1,000 towards a charity of the director’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cole has been a fervent participant of Sing Song since 2015. He has participated in five acts, arranged for nine, and has directed two. Cole is regularly asked to return to ACU to clinic and critque acts before the February production.&lt;/p&gt;
