Hi, I'm Cole! I'm passionate about Music, Technology, Education and melding the three into one. I'm currently attending Stephen F. Austin State University to finish my B.A. in Music Education.

I've graduated Abilene Christian University (2018), earning a B.S. in Computer Science and a Music Minor. While at ACU, I was heavily involved in both the School of Information Technology and Computing and the Music Department. At SFA, I'm serving as a Band Manager as well as an orchestra and choir intern at a prominent church in Nacogdoches.

I have previously worked for USAA in San Antonio, TX as a Front-End Developer, using React.js, Redux, and other technologies to create seamless experiences for members. My love for music drove me to step outside of my comfort zone and return to school to finish my Music Education degree at Stephen F. Austin State University.

My passions include Music, Technology, Education, and how to equip the next generation of students to utilize the full force of these studies to be effective leaders in their communities.
