Sing Song, one of Abilene Christian Univeristy's most-loved traditions since 1957, is an a cappella singing competition in which students prepare rewritten medleys of popular songs that are performed with costumes, sets, and choreography that relate to their chosen theme. Each year, a top act is chosen from each of the three divisions: Men's, Women's, and Class, where the winning acts are awarded $1,000 towards a charity of the director's choice.

I've been fortunate to direct and arrange several acts. This year, I've written one act for a Freshman group, which will be rehearsed for the entire month of January and part of February, leading up to three performances in ACU's Moody Coliseum in front of thousands. The act participants will spend countless hours painting their set, building their costumes, and refining each and every detail in order to win the coveted trophy.

Below are a few of my favorite acts that I've been a part of. All of them are meaningful to me in some way or another. Take a listen:
